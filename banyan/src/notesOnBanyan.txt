x-axis is measuring MHz
y-axis is measuring occurances

Plot Bands:
    colour = black
    Start freq (MHz) - min x coordinate
    Stop freq (MHz) - max x coordinate

Rx Tunes:
    colour = blue
    width = 80MHz

Rx Pre-Selectors:
    colour = green

Antenna Bands:
    colour = light blue

PA Bands:
    colour = pink

Tx Tunes:
    colour = red
    DAC freq (MHz) -
